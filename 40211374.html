                <p>We focus on developing classes that delegate to abstractions. These abstractions are then implemented
                    by other classes, which delegate some work to more abstractions. Eventually, a class is so small and
                    directed that it need not delegate any further, and the chain of dependency is ended. In order to
                    construct the dependent classes, first their dependencies are constructed and then injected in as
                    dependencies.</p>
                <p><br/></p>
                <p>Dependency injection (DI) is a very simple concept with a simple implementation. However, this
                    simplicity belies the importance of the pattern. DI is the glue without which the techniques of
                    SOLID would not be possible.</p>
                <p>Implemented correctly, dependency injection is invisible to the majority of a project’s code.</p>
                <p><br/></p>
                <p>When a dependency exists between class A and class B, if class B has a dependency on class C, it
                    follows that class A is implicitly dependent on class C. If you ensure that your interfaces
                    generalize—that is, that they correctly abstract their behavior—a class that depends on an interface
                    does not depend on anything further. This holds true even though implementations of the interface
                    might depend on something heavy and external, such as a database. </p>
                <p>If you ensure that your interfaces generalize—that is, that they correctly abstract their behavior—a

                    database. </p>
                <p>When used correctly, interfaces provide your code with the extension points that make it
                    adaptive.</p>
