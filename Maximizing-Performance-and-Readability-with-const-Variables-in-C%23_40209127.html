This information is stored in the assembly's metadata table, which is a data structure that contains information about the types, methods, properties, and other elements that make up the assembly.</p><p>When a variable is declared as <code>const</code> its value is known at compile-time and it is embedded into the metadata table of the assembly. The compiler will replace the variable with its value throughout the code, so that the value is available at runtime without the need to look it up in memory.</p><p>This means that the value of a <code>const</code> variable is stored as part of the assembly's metadata, which is stored in memory, rather than in the heap memory. This is more memory-efficient than storing the value in heap memory. This also allows the constant to be accessed directly from the class name, without the need to create an object.</p><p>It's important to note that <code>const</code> variables are implicitly static and their values are shared among all instances of the class, and therefore only one copy is stored in memory.</p><p><br/></p><p>SeeÂ <code><a href="Difference-between-const-and-static-readonly_553977433.html" data-linked-resource-id="553977433" data-linked-resource-version="18" data-linked-resource-type="page">Difference between const and static readonly</a></code></p>
