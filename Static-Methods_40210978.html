                <p>It is beneficial to use static methods when the method does not reference any instance fields, as it
                    improves performance, enhances code readability, promotes better code organization, reduces memory
                    usage, and can be called directly from the class name.</p>
                <p><br/></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Increased performance: Since a static method does not need to be invoked on an instance of a
                        class, it can be called more efficiently.
                    </li>
                    <li>Enhanced readability: When reading code, it is often clearer to see that a method is static and
                        therefore does not rely on any specific instance state.
                    </li>
                    <li>Better organization: By separating methods that operate independently of instances from methods
                        that rely on instance state, the code can be more organized and easier to understand.
                    </li>
                    <li>Lowers memory usage: Since static methods don't require instantiation, it reduces the memory
                        usage when comparing to instance methods.
                    </li>
                    <li>Can be called directly from the class name: You don't need to create an object to call static
                        methods, which is convenient and neat.
                    </li>
                </ol>
