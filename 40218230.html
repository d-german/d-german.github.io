                    <p>“Program to an interface; not an implementation” is a great design principle. The relevant question then becomes: why is programming to an interface desirable?</p><p>One reason is that interfaces are less volatile and simple when compared to concrete implementations. You can use them with less fear of breaking changes. Concrete classes like `Codes` are very simple and should not be changing much. They are DTOs, simple models used to transfer data from place to place. In the past, I frowned upon trying to add a bunch of logic (implementation) to DTOs. So it should be OK to depend on them for similar reasons that we can depend on interfaces.</p><p>TBD</p><p>“Program to an interface; not an implementation” is a great design principle.
