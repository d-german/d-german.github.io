                <p>“Program to an interface; not an implementation” is a great design principle. The relevant question
                    then becomes: why is programming to an interface desirable?</p>
                <p>One reason is that interfaces are less volatile and simple when compared to concrete implementations.
                    You can use them with less fear of breaking changes. Concrete classes like `Codes` are very simple
                    and should not be changing much. They are DTOs, simple models used to transfer data from place to
                    place. In the past, I frowned upon trying to add a bunch of logic (implementation) to DTOs. So it
                    should be OK to depend on them for similar reasons that we can depend on interfaces.</p>
                <p>TBD</p>
