                <p>TBD Still working on this:</p>
                <p><br/></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>Easy to confuse if the programming language doesn't make the distinction.</span></li>
                    <li><span>We use the term inheritance both when a class derives from a non abstract (concrete) class to make a specialized version of it and when an abstract class is used as a starting point for different implementations. Would it be better if we had two different terms for these concepts instead of using the same term? (Shalloway 137)</span>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Implementation: Derived classes inherit data and behavior (implementation) of the base class.</span>
                    </li>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span>C++ approximates this using private inheritance (TBD)</span></li>
                        <li><span>Implementation inheritance can degenerate into “like a” (Coplien 206) relationship when the derived class violates Liskov’s substitution principle.</span>
                        </li>
                        <ol>
                            <li><span>This is only a problem when trying to use the relationship polymorphically. (Coplien 237)</span>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <li><span>When inheritance is used as “is a”, software reuse is an incidental (but important!) benefit. However, reuse is often used to justify degeneration into “like-a” relationships. This may have a short-term reuse benefit, but it may not encapsulate change in the long term. (Coplien 251)</span>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <li><span>Summary:</span></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span> If your primary purpose of inheritance is reuse, then inheritance is being used, incidentally. This <strong>“<em>incidental inheritance</em>”</strong> could give you troubles if trying to use polymorphically. This is important because it is polymorphism that aids in your design to be adaptable, maintainable, extendable and testable.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span> If your main purpose of inheritance is proper subtyping (Liskov substitution) then reuse is an incidental benefit.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <li><span>Interface inheritance: Derived classes inherit only the public interface of the base class and </span><strong>must </strong><span>provide its own implementation.</span>
                    </li>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span>Approximated in C++, by inheriting from pure abstract classes.</span></li>
                        <li><span>C# makes this clear by providing interfaces.</span></li>
                    </ol>
                    <li><span>Of course, you can have a mixture of both.</span></li>
                    <li><span>(GOF 16) Refers to this as Class vs Interface Inheritance.</span></li>
